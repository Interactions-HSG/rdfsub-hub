# RDFSub Hub

This project is a Java implementation of an RDFSub Hub based on [Corese](https://github.com/Wimmics/corese).

## Prerequisites

* JDK 8+

## Running the project

    ./gradlew test run

The command compiles the project and runs the tests, then it launches the application, so you can check by yourself. Open your browser to http://localhost:8080. You should see a _Hello World_ message.

## Building the project

To build the project, just use:

    ./gradlew build

It generates a _fat-jar_ in the `build/libs` directory.
